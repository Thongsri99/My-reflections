I could keep all my work remote so its possible to work in different locations.

--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when i want to further develop another open project.  I may either contributely directly or use it for my own needs. 

Cloning is simply making another copy of a repository.

Branches are seperate partitions of repositories.
